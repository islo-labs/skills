# Bug repro line

Factory line that turns a **bug report posted in Slack** into a **pull request with committed evidence**. It reacts `:eyes:` to acknowledge, reproduces the bug as a failing test, fixes it, reviews the fix, runs your repository's own checks, opens the pull request, and reacts `:white_check_mark:`.

The line loops back to implementation when review or verification rejects the fix, and it stops early with `:x:` when the report cannot be turned into a failing check.

## Stages

| Stage | Job | What it decides |
|-------|-----|-----------------|
| `react-eyes` | `bug-repro-slack-react` | Nothing. Acknowledges the report with `:eyes:` so the reporter knows it was picked up |
| `reproduce` | `bug-repro-reproduce` | `reproduced`. True only when a new test fails for the reported reason |
| `react-fail` | `bug-repro-slack-react` | Nothing. Reacts `:x:` and ends the run when `reproduced` is false |
| `implement` | `bug-repro-implement` | Nothing. Commits the fix on the working branch |
| `review` | `bug-repro-review` | `review_result`. `approved` sends the fix to verification, `needs_changes` sends it back to `implement` |
| `verify` | `bug-repro-verify` | `verdict`. `approved` sends the fix to the pull request, `needs_work` sends it back to `implement` |
| `open-pr` | `bug-repro-open-pr` | `pr_url`. The pull request it pushed and opened |
| `react-success` | `bug-repro-slack-react` | Nothing. Reacts `:white_check_mark:` on the original message |

You deploy `bug-repro-slack-react` once. Three stages use it, each passing a different `emoji` literal.

The two back edges are bounded in `line.toml`. `review` returns to `implement` at most 3 times, `verify` at most 2. `[limits].max_iterations = 12` caps the whole run.

## The shared sandbox

> **Warning.** All six jobs declare an identical `[run.sandbox]` with `mode = "ensure"` and `name = "bug-repro-{{work_key}}"`. This is load bearing. Every stage after `reproduce` works on the branch `fix/{{work_key}}` that `reproduce` created, and that branch only exists inside that one sandbox. If you change the sandbox `name`, `image`, `snapshot_name`, or any other field in one job and not in the other five, the line will not fail loudly. A later stage will land in a different sandbox, find no working branch, and the run will die somewhere confusing.

Change `[run.sandbox]` in all six manifests or in none of them. The same rule applies to the `checkout-repo` step, which is also identical in all six.

`work_key` is the Slack `event_id`, so the sandbox name is stable for the whole run and unique per report.

## How your prompts and scripts get into the sandbox

Nothing here is published to Islo Knowledge. The prompt bodies in `prompts/` and the harness scripts in `harness/` are meant to live in **your** repository, and every job reads them fresh from a git checkout at run time. Your repository stays the single source of truth, and editing a prompt takes a commit rather than a redeploy.

The first step of every job is `checkout-repo`. It configures git credentials from the gateway-injected `GH_TOKEN`, then clones your repository into `/workspace/REPLACE_WITH_REPOSITORY` if it is not already there, or fetches if it is.

> That step deliberately fetches without checking anything out. The working branch `fix/{{work_key}}` belongs to the run, and a step that reset the working tree to the remote head would silently throw away the failing test and the fix. Only `reproduce` creates the branch, and only the per stage `checkout-branch` step moves onto it.

Per-run scratch state lives at `/workspace/.islo-line/bug-repro/{{work_key}}/`, outside the checkout, so it survives every stage without dirtying your working tree.

| Scratch path | Written by | Read by |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| `slack/` | `reproduce` | `reproduce` |
| `review.md` | `review` | `implement` |
| `verify.log`, `verify.status` | `verify` | `implement` |

## Placeholders

Replace all three before you deploy. They appear in the manifests and in the paths inside them.

| Placeholder | Where | Set it to |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| `REPLACE_WITH_OWNER` | the `repo` param default and the clone URL in every job | your GitHub organisation or user |
| `REPLACE_WITH_REPOSITORY` | the `repo` param default, the clone URL, and every `/workspace/` path in every job | your repository name |
| `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_SLACK_CHANNEL_ID` | `[trigger.selector].channels` in `line.toml` | the Slack channel ID your team reports bugs in, for example `C01234ABCDE` |

`REPLACE_WITH_REPOSITORY` is the one to be careful with. It is both the repository name and the checkout directory name, so it appears in the clone URL, in `workdir` values, in every prompt path, and in every harness path.

## Trigger

```toml
[trigger]
type = "integration_trigger"
provider = "slack"
name = "message.received"
```

The line starts on any message in the selected channels.

**`[trigger.selector]`** limits that to `scope = "selected"` with an explicit `channels` list. Keep the list explicit. A wider scope means every message in every channel the integration can see starts a run.

**`[[trigger.filters]]`** carries one entry:

```toml
[[trigger.filters]]
op = "missing"
operand = { type = "trigger", path = "$.event.subtype" }
```

Slack sends `message.received` for far more than a person typing a bug report. Edits, deletions, channel joins and leaves, pinned items, and bot posts all arrive as `message.received` with a `subtype` field set. A plain human message has no `subtype`. This filter drops everything else. Without it, every join notice starts a sandbox and every edit of a report starts a second run against the same bug.

**`[trigger.outputs]`** are the values the line passes into stages.

| Output | Slack path | What it is for |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| `work_key` | `trigger.raw.event_id` | Names the shared sandbox and the working branch. Slack event IDs are stable per event, so a redelivery of the same event reuses the same sandbox and branch instead of starting a parallel attempt |
| `report` | `trigger.raw.event.text` | The bug report text. Handed to `reproduce`, `implement`, `review` and `verify` |
| `slack_channel` | `trigger.raw.event.channel` | Where to react, and where to fetch attachments from |
| `slack_ts` | `trigger.raw.event.ts` | Which message to react to and fetch attachments from |
| `slack_user` | `trigger.raw.event.user` | The reporter, passed through for attribution |

## Job parameters

`work_key` is required in all six jobs and constrained to `^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9._-]{0,62}$`, because it becomes a sandbox name and a git branch name.

| Job | Param | Required | Default | Purpose |
|-----|-------|----------|---------|---------|
| `bug-repro-slack-react` | `slack_channel` | yes | | Channel of the message to react to |
| | `slack_ts` | yes | | Timestamp of the message to react to |
| | `emoji` | yes | | Reaction name without colons. The three stages pass `eyes`, `x`, `white_check_mark` |
| | `work_key` | yes | | Shared sandbox name |
| | `report` | no | `""` | Passthrough, so the line can bind the same inputs to every stage |
| | `slack_user` | no | `""` | Passthrough |
| `bug-repro-reproduce` | `repo` | no | `REPLACE_WITH_OWNER/REPLACE_WITH_REPOSITORY` | Repository in `owner/name` form |
| | `base_branch` | no | `main` | Branch the fix branches off and is reviewed against |
| | `report` | yes | | The bug report text |
| | `work_key` | yes | | Shared sandbox and working branch name |
| | `slack_channel` | yes | | Channel to fetch attachments from |
| | `slack_ts` | yes | | Message to fetch attachments from |
| `bug-repro-implement` | `repo` | no | as above | Repository in `owner/name` form |
| | `base_branch` | no | `main` | Branch the whole-branch diff is read against before committing |
| | `report` | no | | The bug report text |
| | `work_key` | yes | | Shared sandbox and working branch name |
| `bug-repro-review` | `repo` | no | as above | Repository in `owner/name` form |
| | `base_branch` | no | `main` | Branch the diff is read against |
| | `report` | no | | The bug report text |
| | `work_key` | yes | | Shared sandbox and working branch name |
| `bug-repro-verify` | `repo` | no | as above | Repository in `owner/name` form |
| | `report` | no | | The bug report text |
| | `work_key` | yes | | Shared sandbox and working branch name |
| `bug-repro-open-pr` | `repo` | no | as above | Repository the pull request opens in |
| | `base_branch` | no | `main` | Pull request base |
| | `work_key` | yes | | Shared sandbox and working branch name |
| | `report` | no | | Quoted in the pull request body |
| | `recording_path` | no | `evidence/{{work_key}}` | Repository relative path of the evidence `verify` committed. The line binds the real value from the `verify` stage output, so the default only applies when you run this job by hand, and it names the directory rather than the artifact |

`base_branch` defaults to `main` in the four jobs that use it. If your default branch is not `main`, change it in all four.

## Job outputs

| Job | Output | Type | Purpose |
|-----|--------|------|---------|
| `bug-repro-reproduce` | `reproduced` | boolean | Routes to `implement` when true, to `react-fail` when false |
| | `failing_test` | string | Path and name of the test that captures the bug |
| `bug-repro-review` | `review_result` | string | `approved` or `needs_changes` |
| | `summary` | string | The review findings |
| `bug-repro-verify` | `verdict` | string | `approved` or `needs_work` |
| | `summary` | string | The check results |
| | `recording_path` | string | Repository relative path of the committed evidence artifact |
| `bug-repro-open-pr` | `pr_url` | string | The pull request URL |

## Before you deploy

### 1. Connect Slack

Install the Islo Slack integration and grant it the channel your team reports bugs in. The harness scripts and the reactions use the gateway-injected `SLACK_TOKEN`, so there is nothing else to wire.

The gateway profile `default` also injects `GH_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which is what the clone, the push, and `gh pr create` use.

### 2. Commit the prompts and the harness into your repository

The jobs read both from the checkout, so they must exist on your default branch before the first run.

```bash
mkdir -p .islo/prompts .islo/harness
cp <this-repo>/examples/bug-repro/prompts/*.md .islo/prompts/
cp <this-repo>/examples/bug-repro/harness/*.py .islo/harness/
git add .islo && git commit -m "Add bug-repro line prompts and harness" && git push
```

Your repository then contains:

```text
.islo/prompts/{reproduce,implement,review,verify,open-pr}.md
.islo/harness/{slack_react,download_slack_attachments}.py
```

These are yours to specialise. The generic prompts tell the agent to discover your test conventions; once you edit them to name your actual test layout, commands, and evidence format, the line gets sharper with no redeploy.

### 3. Replace the placeholders

Fill in all three placeholders from the table above, across all six job manifests and `line.toml`.

### 4. Deploy the jobs, then the line

Deploy order matters. The line pins a job version per stage at deploy time, so all six jobs must exist first. Deploying the line before the jobs, or changing a job without redeploying the line, leaves the line pinned to a version that is not what you just wrote.

```bash
for j in slack-react reproduce implement review verify open-pr; do
  islo job deploy "bug-repro-$j" --path "examples/bug-repro/jobs/bug-repro-$j/job.toml" --dry-run
  islo job deploy "bug-repro-$j" --path "examples/bug-repro/jobs/bug-repro-$j/job.toml"
done

islo factory line validate examples/bug-repro/line.toml
islo factory line deploy examples/bug-repro/line.toml --dry-run
islo factory line deploy examples/bug-repro/line.toml
```

`islo factory line validate` resolves every stage's `job` against what is deployed on your tenant. Before the six jobs are deployed it fails with `references unknown job`. That is expected and it is why the jobs go first.

### 5. Test with one real Slack report

Post one message with a screenshot attached in the configured channel. Describe a real, small, reproducible bug.

Confirm these four things, in order:

1. The message gets `:eyes:`, within a minute or so.
2. Every stage reports the **same** sandbox name, `bug-repro-<slack-event-id>`. This is the shared-sandbox invariant. If two stages report different sandbox names, stop and diff `[run.sandbox]` across the six manifests.
3. The pull request contains the evidence artifact under `evidence/<slack-event-id>/`, and the failing test that `reproduce` added.
4. The message gets `:white_check_mark:`.

Watch it run:

```bash
islo factory line runs bug-repro
islo factory line-run events <run-id>
```

The events stream is where you see the sandbox name per stage and the stage outputs (`reproduced`, `review_result`, `verdict`, `pr_url`).

**If no run appears at all**, the message never reached the line. Check the trigger side before you look at any job:

```bash
islo factory manager status
islo factory triggers list --with-status
```

In that order. `manager status` tells you the line routing agent is running at all. `triggers list --with-status` tells you whether the Slack trigger is registered, enabled, and receiving deliveries. The usual causes are the Slack integration not granted the channel, a channel ID left as `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_SLACK_CHANNEL_ID`, or a message that the `subtype` filter correctly dropped, which includes anything posted by a bot.

### 6. Remove

Delete the deployed line and the six jobs from your tenant when you no longer need this example.

## If runs are slow

This example ships no snapshot. Every run clones your repository and installs dependencies from scratch, which is the slowest possible first stage and the price of a template that works on any repository.

To fix that, bake a sandbox with your dependencies prebuilt, save it with `islo snapshot save <sandbox> --name <your-snapshot>`, and set `snapshot_name = "<your-snapshot>"` in `[run.sandbox]`.

Set it in **all six** job manifests. `snapshot_name` is part of the shared sandbox spec, and a snapshot set in five jobs out of six is exactly the drift the warning above describes.

## Compared to feature delivery

[`feature-delivery`](../feature-delivery/) runs the same implement, review, verify loop from a Linear label on a planned issue. This line starts from an unplanned bug report in Slack, and it adds the two stages that a bug needs and a feature does not: a reproduction gated on a genuinely failing test, and a Slack reaction thread so the reporter can see it being worked.
